# Setup

1. Install ImageMagick. It's important to not install the newest version, but Version 6, as the newest version doesn't support all necessary bindings yet.

```
/usr/local/opt/imagemagick@6/bin
```

2. Set ENV

```
export MAGICK_HOME=/usr/local/opt/imagemagick@6/
```

3. Install `[wand](docs.wand-py.org)`
